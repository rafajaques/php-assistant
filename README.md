PHP Assistant is a cross-platform desktop app for testing PHP snippets.
Built with Electron, Node.js and HTML5/CSS/JS.
The main goal is to have a simple app to test small pieces of code without having to search for a sandbox, creating a file or opening the terminal.

## Issues

If you have any problems with the app or if you have any suggestions, just open an [issue](https://github.com/rafajaques/php-assistant/issues).

## Translation

The app was released in English, Brazilian Portuguese and French.
So far, with community help, we have: French (@Johann-S), Danish (@peterbrinck), German (@ingowalther).

To translate you need to fork master branch.

In the folder `locales` you will find json files with the app strings.
Copy `en.json` file and rename it as the [language code provided by ISO](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm).

Translate the strings (the ones on the right side) and insert a reference into the list (locales variable) in `main.js` file.

After that, just send a pull request. In advance, I say thank you!
